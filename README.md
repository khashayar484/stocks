# Fipiran 
https://www.fipiran.com/ is a website that has fundamental information about stocks, like earnings, EPS, DPS, etc. 
here I use selenium for crawling this website and get Earning from these stocks.

in this project, I use two classes Crawler and GUI, the first one for crawling the website and get fundamental information and the second one for the graphic user interface.
